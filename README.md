A library of XRM Extensions intended to be used by any XRM project, in any Xrm Plugin/Workflow.  Ever had a QueryExpression, and wished you get generate SQL from the QueryExpression while debugging?  Now you can:  `queryExpression.GetSqlStatement()`.  Ever wish your plugins had a built in method to prevent recusive lookps?  Just inherit from the `GenericPluginHandlerBase`, they will.  Project delivered by a [source only nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DLaB.Xrm.Source/), so you control the version of the Xrm Assemblies it references, and you don't have to IL Merge for you plugins!

## How Can I Help?

DLaB.Xrm is designed to be a community focused, open sourced project.  There are two main ways to help:
Please submit an issue for bugs/feature requests.  If you'd like to contribute:

1.  **Create an issue for a bug/feature request.** - If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature or just need something that is missing, [please create an issue](https://github.com/daryllabar/DLaB-Xrm/issues/new)!  There is no better way to make things better than to share.
2.  **Submit a Pull Request.** - I would highly recommend opening an issue, before doing any major coding so you can get an offical blessing before starting any work!
